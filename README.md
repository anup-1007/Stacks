# Stacks

1. Check balancing of symbols ( like ‘{‘, ‘(‘, ‘[‘ ) and their order using stack.

2. Evaluate postfix expression using stack. Example: postfix fix expression is 6 5 2 3 + 8 * + 3 + *
Hint: When number is seen, it is pushed onto the stack; when an operator is seen, the operator
is applied to the two numbers that are popped from the stack, and the result is pushed onto the
stack.
